Advanced multy timer

#### Intention
This is a proyect that have mainly two objetives:
1. To provide a ease to use timer that can help to keeo track of activities and routines.
2. Lear react-native specifically how to handle background task and different ways of rendering information with a good performance.


#### Time Frame
The idea es to develop this for a year and see where I can get it

#### Planned features
1. Start a timer and been hable to return to that timer even if the app was closed
2. Set a countdown that triggers an alarm and works even if the app is closed or in the background.
3. Been hable to create a secuense of timers like 10 sec, alarm, 20 sec alarm, 30 sec, alarm

#### Ideas
How do I create a fuzzy time period? Something like a variable time line for actions that are not that clear when they start or end and takes in account that humans are not robots
